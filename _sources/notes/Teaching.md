### Code for Teaching and Replication

I like to work with [jupyter](https://jupyter.org), python, geogebra, and other scientific computing and open source tools. Over the years I've build a large number of interactive notebooks and geogebra applets to teach economics and reproduce economics research.  Here are a few of those resources assembled as [jupyter books](https://jupyterbook.org) and shared via github repositories.

All these links will navigate to new sites:
