:::{tab-item} Abstract
**Abstract:** We study a general equilibrium model of enclosures - the costly process by which open-access come to be more exclusively and privately owned.  We model the enclosure process as an aggregative game where population density, technological improvement possibilities, and the costs of establishing property rights determine whether none, some, or all land in a region becomes transformed. The model allows us to study whether labor is displaced or augmented by enclosures, and the implications of enclosure for productive efficiency, wages, land rental rates, and welfare.  We study both atomistic and policy-driven enclosure processes and show how, depending on the environment, either may lead to efficient or inefficient transformation of land rights, and may even lead to costly property-claiming races in yet others. We show how the model may be extended to understand the transformation of more traditional land ownership systems into more modern ownership regimes. The model admits multiple equilibria for some parameters, implying indeterminacy of the property rights regime. We analyze these cases using global game equilibrium selection tools.

:::{tab-item} Abstract
**Abstract:** Hyperbolic discounters value consumption-smoothing commitment contracts, but may fear that these could be renegotiated by future selves and banks. This creates a consumer protection problem even for sophisticated and informed consumers. This paper studies how the threat of renegotiation affects equilibrium commitment contracts and bank governance forms. We find that familiar behaviors such as ‘over’-borrowing or ‘under’-saving emerge, but here as strategic partial concessions to future selves to avoid even costlier renegotiation behaviors later. We then show how it may be to banks’ advantage to offer additional consumer protection either via an appeal for government regulation or through costly private governance/ownership choices. By restricting their own ability to profit from opportunistic renegotiation, banks can expand gains to trade and captured profits. The framework establishes new behavioral micro-foundations for a theory of commercial non-profits and helps explain historical patterns of contracting and ownership forms in consumer banking and microfinance, and how these co-evolved with market structure.
