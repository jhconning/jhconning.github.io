:::{tabbed} Abstract
**Abstract:** Hyperbolic discounters value consumption-smoothing commitment contracts, but may fear that these could be renegotiated by future selves and banks. This creates a consumer protection problem even for sophisticated and informed consumers. This paper studies how the threat of renegotiation affects equilibrium commitment contracts and bank governance forms. We find that familiar behaviors such as ‘over’-borrowing or ‘under’-saving emerge, but here as strategic partial concessions to future selves to avoid even costlier renegotiation behaviors later. We then show how it may be to banks’ advantage to offer additional consumer protection either via an appeal for government regulation or through costly private governance/ownership choices. By restricting their own ability to profit from opportunistic renegotiation, banks can expand gains to trade and captured profits. The framework establishes new behavioral micro-foundations for a theory of commercial non-profits and helps explain historical patterns of contracting and ownership forms in consumer banking and microfinance, and how these co-evolved with market structure.

>Baker, Matthew and Jonathan Conning (2021) [A Model of Enclosures: Coordination, Conflict, and Efficiency in the Transformation of Land Property Rights](https://jhconning.github.io/enclosure_book)

:::{tabbed} Abstract
**Abstract:** We study a tractable equilibrium  model to frame enduring debates regarding how customary or informal land property regimes might be transformed into more exclusive, alienable forms of private property via decentralized or policy-driven 'enclosure' processes. The choice to adopt a new property regime is modeled like a technology adoption as an aggregative game  with the potential spillovers and strategic complementarities. Factors including population density, technology improvement possibilities, crop labor-intensity, and the costs and balance of power in claim contests shape equilibrium outcomes but the potential for multiple equilibria leave room for inherent historical contingency or indeterminacy. None, some, or all lands may become enclosed with differing consequences for output, wages, land rents,  resource (mis)allocation, and structural transformation. Market driven processes may lead to efficient transformation in some cases but coordination   failures may lead   to either inefficient failures to  transform or to excessive or premature enclosures characterized by wasteful redistributive property races and `land grabs.'
