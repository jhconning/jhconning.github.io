## Economics Teaching and Research with Python

 I've put together a collection of interactive notebooks and applets to teach and eproduce research in Economics, using [jupyter](https://jupyter.org), python, geogebra, and open-source scientific computing tools.  Here are a few collections, shared via github repositories.  All links navigate to new sites:
