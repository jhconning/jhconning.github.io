# Jonathan Conning's webpage




This site is used to organize content for a [![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://jhconning.github.io/)

Most of the content is written in markdown (.md) and jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files and then rendered as a jupyterbook website via github pages.
